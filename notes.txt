-----------To push a new project from a local disk
1. Go into your GitHub account and create a new repository (green button at the right side). Don't initialize the repository, follow the instructions on the next step to import an existing repository, the one you just created.
Example
1 git remote add origin https://github.com/guillermoacdc/lab1.git
2 git branch -M main
3 git push -u origin main

The line 2 requires a rename of branch from master to main: git branch -m master main
If after the git status command there is an ouput like
(*) HEAD detached at 4c012fa
nothing to commit, working tree clean

Then you need to type: git checkout master. The (*) output must disappear

-------------to include the build folder in your project and ignore when pushing
1. copy or create the build directory
2. creat a .gitignore file with the content: build/
3. add the .gitignore file to git: git add... 
4. commit the project
5. push the project
